- Within txn if we are modify/update entity even after persist/save entity, JPA will take care of change in entity and sync database. refer: playWithEntityManager()

- @UpdateTimestamp ,@CreationTimestamp : both are hibernate annotation. it is not part of JPA.
- @NamedQuery, @NamedQueries - assign query to variable
