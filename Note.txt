- Within txn if we are modify/update entity even after persist/save entity, JPA will take care of change in entity and sync database.
  refer: playWithEntityManager()

- @UpdateTimestamp ,@CreationTimestamp : both are hibernate annotation. it is not part of JPA.
- @NamedQuery, @NamedQueries - assign query to variable
- @Transactional : it will create transaction for given method or class. it will create persistence context for method or class.


1) @OneToMany : Lazy loading
    Example:
        - One course have multiple reviews
        - One review have single course

2) @OneToOne : eager loading
    Example:
        - Student have single passport.
        - Passport have single Student.

3) @ManyToMany : Lazy loading
     Example:
        - Student can have multiple courses
        - Course can have multiple Student
     - User join table

tip: @_ToOne : eager loading and @_ToMany: Lazy loading
